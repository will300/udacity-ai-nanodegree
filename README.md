# udacity-ai-nanodegree

This repository houses projects containing Python scripts and modules for the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree course, from May 2020. There are 3 main projects, with Adversarial Search being the capstone. All helper files, logs and image files are included. Code frameworks are provided by Udacity with my own personal contributions generally indicated with TODO markers.
